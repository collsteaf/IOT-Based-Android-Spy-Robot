# 🤖 IOT-Based Android Controlled Spy Robot

As an ambitious and innovative engineer, I'm thrilled to share a project my team has made - an IoT-based Android-controlled spy robot equipped with camera surveillance capabilities.

Overview:
In this cutting-edge project, our team developed a sophisticated spy robot capable of gathering real-time intelligence through an integrated camera. By combining the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Android application development, we created a versatile remote-controlled platform designed for surveillance and reconnaissance in various scenarios.

Key Features:

Android Control Interface: Our custom-designed Android application serves as the central control interface for the spy robot. This user-friendly app enables users to seamlessly manoeuvre the robot with intuitive gestures, providing real-time video feedback from the onboard camera.

Real-Time Video Streaming: The spy robot is equipped with a high-resolution camera, allowing live video streaming directly to the Android application. This ensures that users can monitor and analyze remote locations in real time, enhancing situational awareness.

IoT Connectivity: Leveraging IoT technology, we integrated the spy robot into a larger network, enabling seamless communication between the Android app and the robot. This connectivity allows for remote control and data transmission, making the robot an efficient tool for reconnaissance purposes.
